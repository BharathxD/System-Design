# ðŸš€ System Design

Hey there! Welcome to the System Design Compendium. This is a place where I've gathered all my personal notes, insights, resources, and rich diagrams related to system design. It's a collection of knowledge that I think will be really helpful for anyone who's interested in software architecture.

## Overview

In this repository, you'll find a series of personal notes that I've put together during my own journey of exploring system design. These notes offer a practical and applied perspective on the key concepts, principles, and best practices. But that's not all! I've also included rich diagrams to give you a visual understanding of how different components fit together in a system.

Just a heads up, these notes and diagrams aren't meant to replace comprehensive educational resources. They're more like a supplement that can enhance your understanding of system design.
