# Bloom Filter

Bloom filters are approximate data-structures hat says with 100% certainity that an element does not belong to a set

- False positivity rate increases with the increase in the size of the filter
- It was created by a researcher called bloom, so itâ€™s named after him
- Filter = Bit Array

## Practical application of Bloom Filter

- We do not have to re-implement bloom filter
- There are libraries in every single language
- Redis has it as ne of itâ€™s core features (Now-a-days people mostly go with this)
- Use it whenever
  - You need to insert but not remove the data
  - You need a NO with 100% certainity
  - Having false-positivity is okay

**Eg:** Medium recommendation, feed generation, web crawlers, linkedin feed

## Eg: An 8-bit array

Letâ€™s say that we store each of these (apple, ball, cat) in an Array (Filter)

- Respective item will be stored in the array based on the hash function
- So we are only utilizing 1B (One bit) in the array (Itâ€™s very space efficient)

What about finding if an elephant is stored in the array?

- Letâ€™s get the hash â†’ `Elephant â†’ f(elephant) % 8 = 5`
- So at the fifth index in the array, we donâ€™t find any value, so there is no elephant in the list

ðŸ’¡ Thus, when bloom filter says there is no item present â†’ We can be sure of that

But, when bloom filter says the item is present â†’ We still need to check
