### Database Schema [LLD]

| ----- |
| id    |
| name  |

| Membership   |
| ------------ |
| user_id      |
| channel_id   |
| [Checkpoint] |

| created_at |
| message    |

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Always create a separate table just like `subscription`, you can also add fields like checkpoint, muted, read_till. Also make sure that it should be a `noun`

### WebSockets

---

Every user will have 1 WebSocket connection open with our backend infrastructure and that will be used for anything and everything that happens `real-time`

**Edge Servers**

Because WebSocket are `expensive` and browsers have a **6 Concurrent TCP** connection limit, we have to multiplex all realtime communication on `ONE WEBSOCKET` connection

Hence, we need a fleet of servers (Edge Servers) to whom our end users connect over WebSocket [WS]
