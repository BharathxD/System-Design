# Design a social media network

### CDN

---

CDN transparently sits between your user and the origin

Consider this scenario: Your point of origin is **[https://example.com](https://example.com/)**, and it hosts a variety of content types, such as JSON, Bytes, HTML, Video, Image, and more.

Meanwhile, your Content Delivery Network (CDN) operates under its distinct domain, like **[https://eg.mycdn.net](https://eg.mycdn.net/)**.

### Bandwidth Concern Pre-signed URL with expiration

### Schema

---

| Post ‚ùå |
| ------- |
| user_id |
| caption |
| url     |

Building the table in the manner shown above would be highly suboptimal. Why? Because if something is derivable, there is no need to store it.

**So what‚Äôs the better way of building it?**

The user keeps track of the random image ID it got from the image it uses this create the entry in the posts table

| Posts ‚úÖ |
| -------- |
| id       |
| user_id  |
| image_id |
| caption  |

URL Decomposition: s3://images/`<user_id>`/`<image_id>`

- Linked[In] also does this
- CDNs also do this

<aside>
üí° When the organization decides to switch from, for example, Cloudflare CDN to Amazon CloudFront CDN, changing all the URLs in the tables can be a cumbersome process.

‚ö†Ô∏è Anything that is derivable, don‚Äôt store the derived information

### Privacy

---

1. Is Instagram's private photo feature truly private? Not quite.
2. Each photo URL is accompanied by a timed signature within the URL.
3. When the URL is rendered via an IMG tag, the request is directed to a Content Delivery Network (CDN).
4. The CDN validates the request by utilizing the attached keys and verifying the validity and expiration status of the certificates.
5. It's important to note that the URL has a limited lifespan due to the short duration of the certificates.

### Image Optimizations

---

1. Users belong to different geographies, different network bandwidths, different mobile devices, different processing power
2. So, sending 5MB photo uploaded by your favourite celeb to all the followers is a very bad idea!
3. So we should have different resolutions of photos ready to server to the users depending on their ‚Äústate‚Äù

<aside>
üí° Instead of building our image optimizer service, we can use CDN that gives this feature out-of-the-box

## The Hastag Service

- Millions of hashtags
- Assume there is a service that notifies us where it generates ‚Äútop‚Äù photos for a hashtag

### Brainstorm

- Storage
- Counting (In the large volumes)
- Inter-service communication (Posts service to Hashtag service ensuring atomicity and partial update)
- Super-fast response times

![UI demonstration](https://bharath-lakshman-kumar.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/Design+a+Social+Media+Network/hastag_overview.png)

Given that we are keeping track of only top 100 posts, it‚Äôs probably better to store all 100 posts in an array for a particular hashtag

**First Approach (Consistant)**

```json
{
    tag: "sunset",
    total_photos: 1_200_000,
    top_100: ["user_1", "user_2", ....]
}
```

`Fast, less space but needs to talk to posts db`

**Second Approach (Efficient)**

```json
{
    tag: "sunset",
    total_photos: 1_200_000,
    top_100: [
        {
            id,
            ....
        },
        ....
    ]
}
```

`Large space, fast time and do not need to talk to posts db`

It all comes down to the Preference or SLA

### How do we update total number of photos and top hundred posts?

---

PS: It need not to happen in real-time

![Demonstration on how updateing the count and top 100 posts work](https://bharath-lakshman-kumar.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/Design+a+Social+Media+Network/update_count_and_posts.png)

- Reads POST_PUBLISH events from kafka
- Extract all the hashtags from the post
- Creates `n` new events on topic `POST_HASHTAG` from n hosts partitioned by hashtag

<aside>
üí° Note that we are using hash-based partitioning. You may have three partitions, and millions of hashtags are distributed across them (Same goes for kafka with user_id partition)
