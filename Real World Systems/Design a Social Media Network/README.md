CDN transparently sits between your user and the origin

Consider this scenario: Your point of origin is **[https://example.com](https://example.com/)**, and it hosts a variety of content types, such as JSON, Bytes, HTML, Video, Image, and more.

Meanwhile, your Content Delivery Network (CDN) operates under its distinct domain, like **[https://eg.mycdn.net](https://eg.mycdn.net/)**.

### Schema

| Post ‚ùå |
| ------- |
| user_id |
| caption |
| url     |

Building the table in the manner shown above would be highly suboptimal. Why? Because if something is derivable, there is no need to store it.

**So what‚Äôs the better way of building it?**

The user keeps track of the random image ID it got from the image it uses this create the entry in the posts table

| Posts ‚úÖ |
| -------- |
| id       |
| user_id  |
| image_id |
| caption  |

URL Decomposition: s3://images/`<user_id>`/`<image_id>`

- Linked[In] also does this
- CDNs also do this

üí° When the organization decides to switch from, for example, Cloudflare CDN to Amazon CloudFront CDN, changing all the URLs in the tables can be a cumbersome process.
