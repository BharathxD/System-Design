# Snowflake at Discord

Discord's Snowflake ID generation follows a similar logic to Twitter's Snowflake, with one key difference. Discord's epoch is set to the first second of the year 2015, allowing for a larger range of unique IDs.

This approach ensures the generation of unique IDs within the Discord ecosystem.
