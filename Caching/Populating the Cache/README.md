# Populating the Cache

When it comes to populating the cache, there are two main strategies to consider:

## Lazy Population (Popular)

This approach is quite popular and works as follows:

- First, check the cache to see if the data you need already exists, if it does, simply return that data.
- If the data is not found in the cache, you then go to the database or perform any heavy operations necessary to obtain the data.
- Once you have the data, persist it in the cache for future use.
- Finally, return the data to the user.

An example where this approach is commonly used is caching blogs. It's a method that optimizes performance by fetching data from the cache when available, reducing the load on the database.

## Eager Population

On the other hand, we have the Eager Population strategy, which operates slightly differently:

- With Eager Population, both database and cache writes happen within the same request call.
- This method is suitable for scenarios where you anticipate the need for certain data, and you proactively push that data to the cache. For instance, in the case of live cricket scores, where you want to make sure the latest scores are readily available in the cache.
- Eager Population is also useful when you expect a specific piece of data, such as a tweet from a popular person, to be accessed frequently. In this case, you cache the tweet in advance to ensure quick retrieval.

ðŸ’¡ Both Lazy Population and Eager Population strategies have their own merits, and the choice between them depends on the specific requirements of your application and the nature of the data you're dealing with.
