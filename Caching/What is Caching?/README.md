### Caching is fast and expensive
---
- Hence we donâ€™t cache all the data (Just a subset of data that is most likely to be accessed).
- `**Note: Caches are not restricted to RAM based storage**`
- Any storage, hat is â€˜nearerâ€™ nd helps you avoid something expensive is a cache for you
- SImply put, Caches are just glorified hash tables
