# Consistent Hashing

One of the most amazing and popular algorithm out there and the only problem it solves is data ownership

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Hashing logic is `NOT` a 'serviceâ€™, but just a simple code running in the load balancerâ€™s code (Itâ€™s a simple function)

</aside>

## Hash Based Ownership

Say, we have a load balancer and when a request comes in, it uses hash of access token to decide which backend server to forward it to

SHA-256 or SHA-128 are popular choices

SH256(u1) = x

server = x % 3 = i

## Load balancers are stateless

1. Because the API servers are stateless.
2. Which means every server is equally capable of handling requests it doesnâ€™t matter if the request that was handled by server 1 now starts going to server 0
3. This is precisely why we see â€˜Hash Based Routingâ€™ as one of the most common ways of routing for stateless backends
4. eg: Load Balancer + API Servers

## Hash based â€˜Routingâ€™ (Ownership) for distributed storage

![Hash based routing for distributed storage](../Images/Consistent%20Hashing/hash-based-routing.png)

Say we want to share 6 keys: `k1, k2, k3, k4, k5 and k6`

```rs
k1 â†’ fn(k1) % 3 = 2

k1 â†’ fn(k2) % 3 = 0

k1 â†’ fn(k3) % 3 = 1

k1 â†’ fn(k4) % 3 = 2

k1 â†’ fn(k5) % 3 = 1

k1 â†’ fn(k6) % 3 = 0
```

The only challenge is: If a storage node is removed or added, the proxy connot just forward request to any arbitrary node because it wonâ€™t have the data

- Now, all the keys would need to be re-evaluated and moved to the correct node
  - It involves a lot of data transfer

## Can we minimize the data movement?

This is where **consistent hashing** comes in

### What is consistent hashing?

Consistent hashing is an algorithm that helps in ddetermining data ownership (In the sense, who owns this data)

### What consistent hashing is not?

- It will not do data transfer for us
- It is not a â€˜serviceâ€™ in itself

## Hash Function (SHA 128)

Given hash functions are cyclic we can visualize it as a ring of integers, every node occupies one slot in the ring, the slot is calculated by passing the nodeâ€™s IP address

![Circular Hash Demonstration](../Images/Consistent%20Hashing/circular-hash.png)

We donâ€™t need any circular linked-list kind of datastructures here, itâ€™s just a simple array and can be part of a proxy

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ **Recipe**
k1 â†’ hash â†’ 0 â†’ node to the right â†’ which is node 0

k2 â†’ hash â†’ 10 â†’ node to right â†’ which is node 3

</aside>

### Scaling up

When we add a new node to the â€˜ringâ€™,

- Say Node 3 (Which is a new node) hashes to slot 1
- The keys that hashed between slot 12 and slot 1 will now be â€˜ownedâ€™ by node 3 instead of node 0
- Other keys continue to remain at the respective nodes
  - **i.e: Minimal Data Movement**
- Operationally, you just have to:
  1. Snapshot Node 0
  2. Create Node 3
  3. Delete unused keys

### Scaling down

- Say we scale down and remove node 0
- All the keys that were owned by Node 0 will now be owned by Node 2 (next in the ring)
  - **ie: Minimal Data Transfer**
- Operationally, you just have to:
  1. Copy everything from Node 0 to Node 2
  2. Remove Node 0 from the ring
