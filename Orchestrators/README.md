# Orchestrators: Keeping Your Servers Running Smoothly

**What Are Orchestrators?**

Imagine orchestrators as the vigilant guardians of your server infrastructure. Their job? To keep a watchful eye on your servers 24/7. If one of your servers ever decides to take an unscheduled break, orchestrators jump into action. They not only find a new server to replace the one that's down but also seamlessly integrate it into the whole server balancing act.

**Why Leader Election Matters**

Think of leader election as the epic showdown among orchestrators. It's the moment when they decide who gets to wear the crown â€“ or in this case, who becomes the leader orchestrator. If the current leader ever has a bad day and goes offline, a new leader gets elected from the ranks of worker orchestrators, ensuring the show goes on.
