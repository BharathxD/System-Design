# How to Approach System Design

When it comes to designing a system, there are two common approaches you can consider: the "Spiral" approach and "Incremental Building."

## Spiral Approach

Imagine this as the heart of your system. With the Spiral approach, you start by identifying the core elements your system needs, and then you build everything around them. Think of it as designing your system based on specific use cases, such as managing a database or making sure your communication channels work seamlessly.

## Incremental Building

Think of system design as a step-by-step process:

1. **Day Zero Architecture:** Start with a basic plan that outlines the fundamental components of your system.

2. **Performance Evaluation:** Check how each part of your system behaves under different conditions. Think about what happens when lots of people use it or when it needs to handle a ton of data.

   1. **Under Load:** Test how your system performs when it's really busy.

   2. **At Scale:** Consider how your system behaves as it grows and gets bigger over time.

3. **Identify Bottlenecks:** Find out where your system might slow down or struggle.

4. **Re-Architect:** Make improvements and changes to fix any issues you've found.

5. **Repeat:** Keep going through these steps to keep making your system better.

## Things to Keep in Mind

1. First, understand what your system is all about and how people will use it.

2. Don't jump to using specific technologies (like DynamoDB or Redis) without really thinking about why you need them.

3. Try to develop an intuition for building systems over time.
